## 💼 Projects

### 🔹 EV Battery Monitoring & Management System  
Real-time monitoring with fault detection, threshold-based alerting via buzzer and LEDs, and scrollable I2C LCD interface. Features include moving average filters, debounce logic, and modular IoT upgrade support.

### 🔹 Solving L7805 Overheating with Smart PCB Design  
Redesigned a linear voltage regulator layout using KiCad for efficient heat dissipation and power distribution. Utilized thermal reliefs, copper pours, and strict design rules.

### 🔹 Emotion Recognition Using EEG (Final Year Project)  
Real-time emotion classification (e.g., happiness/sadness) using EEG signal processing and machine learning. Applications in mental health diagnostics and adaptive interfaces.

### 🔹 Mini Projects  
- **Smart Water Tank Monitor** – Ultrasonic sensor + Arduino with LCD alerts  
- **Digital Calendar** – RTC-based real-time clock system with user adjustment buttons
